Refactor the noise filtering code with the following requirements:

1. Remove all noise filter levels (low, medium, aggressive), keep only "high".
   - Update the export type `NoiseFilterLevel` to only allow "high".
   - Ensure the default pipeline runs with "high" profile.

2. Delete `audioFilters.ts` entirely and remove all references to it.

3. Implement the processing chain in the following order (Chain B):
   Highpass Filter → Notch (hum) Filter → Noise Gate → Speech Enhancer → Lowpass Filter → Compressor → Limiter

4. Parameters for "high" profile:
   - **Highpass filter**: frequency = 220 Hz, Q = 0.9 (adaptive between 200–250 Hz acceptable).
   - **Notch filter**: center frequency = 50 Hz (or 60 Hz depending on locale), Q = 40.
   - **Noise Gate**:
       - openThreshold = 0.015
       - closeThreshold = 0.009
       - holdTime = 250 ms
       - lookAhead = 8 ms (DelayNode)
       - RMS calculation should be weighted between 300–4000 Hz band.
   - **Speech enhancer (peaking filter)**:
       - center frequency = 2800 Hz
       - gain = +4 dB
       - Q = 1.4
   - **Lowpass filter**: frequency = 6000 Hz, Q = 0.8
   - **Compressor**:
       - threshold = -20 dB
       - ratio = 5:1
       - attack = 2 ms
       - release = 120 ms
       - knee = 15 dB
   - **Limiter**:
       - threshold = -3 dB
       - release = 100 ms

5. WebRTC getUserMedia constraints:
   - Use `ideal` instead of `exact` where possible.
   - Example: `{ channelCount: { ideal: 1 }, sampleRate: { ideal: 48000 } }`.
   - Keep echoCancellation/noiseSuppression as fallback if browser does not support `voiceIsolation`.

6. Remove `autoGainControl` when running the "high" profile, since compressor + limiter already handle dynamics.

7. Add lightweight output normalizer:
   - Adjust gain ±1–2 dB to stabilize loudness after compressor.

8. Add auto-calibration logic on startup:
   - Record first 800 ms of background before speech.
   - Estimate noise floor (RMS) and spectrum.
   - Adjust noise gate threshold and HPF cutoff accordingly:
     - High noise floor → raise gate threshold + increase HPF cutoff toward 250 Hz.
     - Low noise floor → lower gate threshold + reduce HPF cutoff toward 180 Hz.
